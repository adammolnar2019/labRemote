Here contains general notes about the gui:

The yoffset is defined to be -0.3. And only when concerning the chips does it seem to be added into the code. 
dy here is defined to be dy-=yoffset or dy-=-0.3. The only two locations I found where yoffset was present was when calibrating the xy and when doing the object detection/correctionGenerated. I could find no comments to explain why this exists.

Go 2 chip:
Go 2 chip is only activated when xy is calibrated. Firstly what it does is seperate the probe card from the wafer if they are in contanct.
Then it calls the function go2chip, which essentially finds the chip we have input and makes the probe station move to it.
If with correction is on it runs the command endchip which emits the signal that the chip has arrived. 
It also finds the height of that chip using the height table and moves to that height.

To find out what chip to move to it looks at it uses a function called find_chip_number but this simply splits the input that the user gives into two seperate numbers.
Ie if we give in 5-6 it seperated the two. 

Calibrate Z:
When the calibrate Z button is pushed it runs the function autoZcal.start. Here autoZcal is the id for a variable of the clazz Calibrate Z. 
When we call autoZcal.start it does the following:
It checks to see if a bunch of pointers are intiliazed and does some diagnostics. And then if m_worker exists it does (*m_worker).startRun(). This is a slot that sets m_running to true.This is required to run the CalibrateWorker.
